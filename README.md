## :left_speech_bubble: Reflection
I started doing this project on June 24, 2022 and finished it in a week. It took me a long time working out on the logic of storing data in objects and I implemented and changed a lot of things. I think it was around 3 days ago that I actually finished this project, however my code really looked like spaghetti which has more than 350 lines. Realizing that, I tried to modify lots of things to really make my code as minimal and clean as possible. Though I will not call my code the cleanest code possible, I still did my best to reduce the lines and still make it functional and readable for me. I had fun doing this and I think this is my most favorite project to do as of now due to lots of challenges, trials, and errors I faced and overcame.
